Homework 2: Problems - Variables, Values, and Types

**1)**

a = 1
  
    a =

     1
     
     Sets the value of a to 1.
     
b = 'x'
 
    b =

    'x'
    
    Sets the value of b to 'x'
    
c = true

    c =

    logical

    1
    
    Sets the value of c to 1, which makes C true
    
whos a b c
   
    Name      Size            Bytes  Class      Attributes

    a         1x1                 8  double               
    b         1x1                 2  char                 
    c         1x1                 1  logical         
    
    Lists the current variables, sizes, and types
    
a == c

    ans =

    logical

    1
    
    Since a = 1 and c = true (1), this statement is logical with a value of 1
    
a + c

    ans =

    2
    
    This adds the a and c values together 
    
d = [1 2 3 4]

    d =

     1     2     3     4
     
    Creates a 1x4 matrix and assigns the numbers to d
    
e = ['a' 'b' 'c' 'd']

    e =

    'abcd'
    
    Sets the value of e to the 1x4 matrix of the variables a, b, c, and d
    
f = ['abcd']

    f =

    'abcd'
    
    Sets the value of f to the 1x4 matrix of the product of variables abcd
