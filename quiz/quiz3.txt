Quiz 3

1)

    The difference between * and the .* operator is that * signifies regular multiplication, whereas
    .* signifies element wise multiplication. The first operator would multiply a matrix by the matrix
    multiplication rules whereas an elementwise multiplication would multiply the values in the matrix
    by their respective row/column.
    
    x = [2;1]
    
    y = [3,6]
     
    x * y

    ans =

     6    12
     3     6
     
     x.*y

    ans =

     6    12
     3     6
     
2)

    sum(A .* B)

    ans =

     23
     
3)

    function f = testString(x)
    x = input('Enter Something');
    if (x == 'Matlab')
        f = true;
        disp(f);
    else 
        f = false;
        disp(f);
    end
end

    Enter SomethingMatlab
   
   true
    
    
    Enter Somethingx
    
   false

4)

  The logical operator || improves code effeciency because it checks the first value and if it is logical, then it works.
  The | checks every single vector. 

5)

   To gain an expression where x=0, the simplest change would be to change the divisor symbol
   
   x = a\b>10

x =

  logical

   0
   
   

6) The structure array would be more computationally efficient to represent the student data for calculating
the average grade in the class because it is easier for the programmer/anyone to read. It also condenses the
amount of computing the programmer has to do.

7)function t = getRoot(a, b, c)
    t.x1 = ((-b + sqrt(((b^2))-4*(a)*(c))/(2*a)));
    t.x2 = ((-b - sqrt(((b^2))-4*(a)*(c))/(2*a)));
    return
end

getRoot(1, 0 ,-1)

ans = 

  struct with fields:

    x1: 1
    x2: -1

8)

function [i] = integral(a,b,c)
    i = integral(x^2 + cx + 1)dx
